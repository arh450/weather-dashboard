// Input bar with search button that allows user to search for city
// User city input then stored to empty variable
// Must store and grab user input to/from localstorage

// Going to need to create three AJAX calls
// One will show the city name, date, current temp(F), current humidity, current wind speed
// One will to get UV index
// The other will display the 5-day forcast for the user's searched city and display, date, weather image, temp(f), and the humdity

// Will moment.js be needed for current date??? or is it already in api?
